tools: Froyocomb Helper & Environment Setup
===========

## Froyocomb Helper
@Dobby233Liu's CSS script, that highlights all commits present to a certain point in time, which helps massively with the process of reconstructing Android builds.

## Froyocomb Environment Setup
@inteneich's Bash script, which should replace all bullshit guides that were present in froyocomb/android before.

You can download the script from the repo or use this command, there are no dependencies required.

```sudo bash -c "$(wget -qO- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/froyocomb/tools/main/envsetup.sh)"```
