# Fake Market
This is an app that spoofs the Market icon seen in the top right corner of the all apps list in Android Ice Cream Sandwich. The application acts as a Market in order to trick the operating system into thinking Google applications are installed. It does not serve any other purpose.

In order to launch the app via the icon in the all apps list, the phone must be rebooted after the installation of the app.
